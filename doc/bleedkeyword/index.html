<h1><code>bleed</code> Keyword</h1>

<p>The <code>bleed</code> keyword is a new concept of NAL which has the following semantic:</p>

<p class="important">A symbol declared/defined with <code>bleed</code> automatically becomes visible in the scope directly outside of the one it is defined in.</p>

<p>This has two main applications: Control structure scope and function scope.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>A symbol is only bleeded one scope outside, not multiple ones. In order to bleed a symbol further outside, it has to be marked with <code>bleed</code> again upon declaration/definition.</li>
<li>Bleeding a symbol solves one of the ownership problems. When a scope would like to change the content of a variable using a method for example, in C and C+, it provides a "reference" to the object to the method which then changes it. But this disrupts ownership. When a variable though is created inside the method which is then bleeded outwards, the outer scope can simply replace the owned variable with the (bleeded) returned one.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Control Structure Scope</h2>

<p>In the following simple example, the index used inside of the for loop becomes visible outside of the loop.</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    for (bleed i in myArray) {
      if (myArray[i] == nullptr) break;
    }
    printf("The resulting index is %i", i);
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    size_t _i;
    for (; _i < _nalArraySize(myArray); ++_i) {
      if (myArray[_i] == nullptr) break;
    }
    printf("The resulting index is %d", (int)_i);
  </code>
</div>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>The symbol name is not available BEFORE the scope declaration.</li>
<li>The lifespan of the symbol is extended till the end of the outer scope.</li>
<li>The symbol name must be unique in the outside scope.</li>
<li>As the symbol name must be unique in the outside scope, prepending a simple underscore <code>_</code> in C is sufficient.</li>
<li>By default, no matter whether the symbol is const or mutable inside the inner scope, it will be const in the outer scope by default. If desired, an additional <code>mutable</code> keyword makes it mutable in the outer scope: <code>for (mutable bleed i in myArray) { ...</code></li>
<li>In C++, there are the std library function like <code>find_if</code>. The same example as above would be written like this in C++:
<code>auto it = std::find_if(myArray.begin(), myArray.end(), [=](const auto& elem){return elem == nullptr;});
size_t index = it - myArray.begin();</code>
</li>
<li>bleed bleed bleed is not possible. Needs to be re-bleeded in the outer scope.</li>
<li>lifetime of bleed. See as an example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html</li>
</ul>




<h2>Function Scope</h2>

<p>In the following simple example, the variable used inside of the function becomes accessible to the calling scope as optional return value.</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    getSum = (myArray = array) f32 {
      bleed size = myArray.size();
      sum = f32(0.);
      for (i in myArray) { sum += myArray[i]; }
      return sum;
    }
    
    {
      theSum, size: theSize = getSum(myArray);
      printf("Average: %f", theSum / mySize);
    }
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    float getSum(_NALArray myArray, i32* _size) {
      _nal_bleeding_size = _nalGetArraySize(myArray);
      float sum = 0.;
      for (size_t i = 0; i < _nal_bleeding_size; ++i) { sum += myArray[i]; }
      _size = _nal_bleeding_size;
      return sum;
    }

    {
      i32* _nal_bleeded_size;
      float theSum = getSum(myArray, _nal_bleeded_size);
      const i32* theSize = _nal_bleeded_size;
      printf("Average: %f", theSum / theSize.toF32());
    }
  </code>
</div>

<p>If someone is not interested in the optional <code>size</code> return value, one simply writes the following. The variable <code>_nal_devnull</code> is a variable where anything can be written to but it will be completely ignored.</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    {
      theSum = getSum(myArray);
    }
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    {
      float theSum = getSum(myArray, _nal_devnull);
    }
  </code>
</div>
