Description:
------------

NAL is an experimental language definition which builds upon the C programming language, more preciesly a secure subset of it.

NAL is short for Not A Language. This has two meanings: It should be easy to create a compiler which converts code written in NAL back to C and use existing C compilers directly. Hence, it is not really a "new" language, but just a shell around an existing one. Second, it derived from long-year experiences of using the NALib library, an engineering library written in C. NALib is short for Not A Library.
