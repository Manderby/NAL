<h1>Things to throw away or replace</h1>

<p>Remember, NAL shall be "transcodable" to C, therefore in this section, we show how things in NAL can be converted to C if removed or replaced.</p>



<h2 id="arrowoperator">Arrow operator <code>-&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Compilers know the type of a value when transcoding to C and hence can automatically decide whether it is a pointer or not. No need to have two separate operators <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>.</code> therefore. To make code look like other programming languages, we favor the dot operator.</p>

<!--
<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    MyClass myObject;
    myObject = new MyClass(); 
    myValue.memberName;
    myPointer.memberName;
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    i64 myValue;
    MyType* myPointer;
    myValue.memberName;
    myPointer->memberName;
  </code>
</div>
-->

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Maybe add ~> (Tilde-Pointer) for backwards combatibility for crazy people still wanting to have unsecure pointer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="inttypes"><code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>signed</code>, <code>unsigned</code></h2>

<p>The type <code>int</code> and its modifiers <code>short</code> and <code>long</code> are system dependent. Additionally, the modifiers <code>signed</code> and <code>unsigned</code> are just cumbersome. We replace this all with built-in types:</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    i8
    i16
    i32
    i64
    ...
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    int8_t
    int16_t
    int32_t
    int64_t
    ...
  </code>
</div>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    u8
    u16
    u32
    u64
    ...
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    uint8_t
    uint16_t
    uint32_t
    uint64_t
    ...
  </code>
</div>




<h2 id="char"><code>char</code></h2>

<p>In C, the type <code>char</code> has the semantics of storing one character. That is usually 1 Byte but not necessary, therefore system dependent. Additionally, <code>char</code> is accessible as a number which is semantically wrong. We replace the type with the following.</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    letter
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    char
  </code>
</div>

<p>A <code>letter</code> is encoded in UTF-8. It is not accessible as a number, unless one uses converter methods like <code>myLetter.ToASCIINum()</code>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li class="important">Instead of <code>letter</code>, how about <code>glyph</code>?</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="floats"><code>float</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code></h2>

<p>We replace the floating point types of C with the following:</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    f32 
    f64 
    f128
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    float
    double
    long double (if available as 128 bit)
  </code>
</div>

<p>And we allow for newer floating point types like <code>f16</code> (which would correspond to the IEEE-754 <code>half</code> type) or <code>f128</code> (which would correspond to the IEEE-754 <code>quad</code> type)</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Originaly, the proposal to use <code>single</code> and <code>double</code> was given but was quickly abandoned.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="postfix">Operators <code>++</code> and <code>--</code></h2>

<p class="important">After discussion, all <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators shall be deleted. There is little to gain from it.</p>

<p>Original discussion:</p>

<p>There is a prefix and postfix variant of both <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>. The postfix variant has the semantics of changing the value AFTER its access. We do not allow for these variants anymore.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li class="important">Why not removing all Increment and Decrement operators. <code>i += 1</code> is not hard to write or even <code>i = i + 1</code>.</li>
<li>Postfix operators are used favourably with pointer arithmetics. As we can not allow pointer arithmetics anymore, there is one more reason to let go.</li>
<li>It is not hard for a programmer to rewrite a line of code such that a postfix operator is not necessary anymore.</li>
<li>In C++, the postfix operator usually is also frowned upon as it complicates operator overloading.</li>
<li><code>++</code> and <code>--</code> is often used in C for the <code>for</code> loop. But as we change the <code>for</code> loop anyway, there is one less reason to have these operators.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="underscore" class="badidea">Underscore <code>_</code> as a symbol character</h2>

<p class="important">Discarded.</p>

<p>Idea was to disallow the underscore <code>_</code> as a character in symbol names. Was smiled at by a few but frowned upon my many and overal.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>People get angry when it comes to naming conventions.</li>
<li><code>snake_case</code> is debatably easier to read than <code>camelCase</code>.</li>
<li><code>m_member</code> would not be possible anymore.</li>
<li><code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code> would not be possible anymore.</li>
<li>There would basically only be two case possibilies to distinguish: <code>lowerCamelCase</code> and <code>UpperCamelCase</code>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="dowhile"><code>do-while</code></h2>

<p>Replace <code>do-while</code> with a new keyword <code>until</code>. Put condition before <code>{}</code> Block. This needs a new thinking bucause the condition is inverted. But it is more intuitive and corresponds more closely to the semantic such a loop represents.</p>

<div class="twoCodes">
  <code>
    NAL:
    until(condition) {
      ...
    }
  </code>
  <code>
    C:
    do {
      ...
    } while (!condition)
  </code>
</div>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Original idea was to remove <code>do-while</code> completely without replacement.</li>
<li>Other idea was to replace it with an <code>dowhile</code> loop but without inverted condition.</li>
<li><code>until</code> is used in other languages but just as an inversion of a normal <code>while</code> loop, so that might be a problem.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="comma">Comma operator <code>,</code></h2>

<p>There is no need for a comma operator. Erase it without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>The comma operator is sometimes used in C for the <code>for</code> loop. But as we change the <code>for</code> loop anyway, there is one less reason to have these operators.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="union"><code>union</code> Type</h2>

<p>There really isn't that much of purpose in having a <code>union</code> type. Erase it without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unions might be handy when working with network protocols. But as NAL shall not target system programmers, that is not really an issue.</li>
<li>Unions can be useful to have either a const or non-const member (as done in NALib). But that might become obsolete with a better type system.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="bitfield">Bitfields</h2>

<p>There really isn't that much of purpose in having Bitfields. Erase it without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>NAL shall not target system programmers, that is not really an issue.</li>
<li>People are accustomed to use masks on integer values.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="arraytype">Array type <code>[]</code></h2>

<p>Ditch the declaration with <code>[]</code> as it induces the usage of pointer arithmetic. Define a built-in <code>array</code> type instead.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>[]</code> type evaluates to a pointer to the first element of an array. That has no purpose if we aren't allowing pointer arithmetics anymore.</li>
<li>Arrays must become safe.</li>
<li>When arrays are gone, so are strings. It becomes its own class. Maybe built in to the language. Deal with it.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="pointerarithmetic">Pointer arithmetics</h2>

<p>Pointer arithmetics are inherently unsafe. We need to get rid of it. The only real thing which needs to be replaced is the <a hreaf="#arraytype">array type <code>[]</code></a> which can be replaced by a built-in type <code>array</code>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>This also eliminates one of the primary uses of the arithmetic <a href="#postfix">postfix operators <code>++</code> and <code>--</code></a> which we will ditch as well.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="generalfor">General <code>for</code> loop declaration</h2>

<p>The general declaration of a <code>for</code> loop in C like <code>for (init; condition; step)</code> will be removed. Instead, <code>for</code> loops shall only be used for <a href="../rangefor/index.html">range based loops</a>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Range based loops have become the primary use of <code>for</code> loops.</li>
<li>The three statements <code>init</code>, <code>condition</code> and <code>step</code> were often misused.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="goto"><code>goto</code> statement</h2>

<p>The <code>goto</code> statement has no more use. Remove it completely without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pros Cons...</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="asm"><code>asm</code> statement</h2>

<p>The <code>asm</code> statement shall be removed completely without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>NAL shall not target system programmers, so we do not do <code>asm</code>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="inline"><code>inline</code> keyword</h2>

<p>The <code>inline</code> keyword shall be removed completely without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>NAL has no more header files.</li>
<li>Compilers know better than the programmer what shall be inlined.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="register"><code>register</code> keyword</h2>

<p>The <code>register</code> keyword shall be removed completely without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>NAL is not targeted to system programmers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="volatile"><code>volatile</code> keyword</h2>

<p>The <code>volatile</code> keyword shall be removed completely without replacement.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>NAL is not targeted to system programmers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="multidecl">Multiple variable declaration with comma</h2>

<p>Do not define multiple variables with commmas <code>,</code>.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't cost much time to do it in separate lines.</li>
<li>Isn't a problem anymore when we have no more pointer types.</li>
<li>Looks terrible.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="assignoperators">Operators <code>%=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code></h2>

<p>Ditch these three operators.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>%=</code> makes no sense mathematically.</li>
<li>Shift operators are just too seldom.</li>
<li>The operators <code>+=</code> <code>-=</code> <code>*=</code> and <code>/=</code> are usefule and simplify programming. Leave them.</li>
<li>The operators <code>&amp;=</code> <code>|=</code> and <code>^=</code> are useful and simplify programming flags and bools. Leave them</li>
</ul>
