<h1>Ownership</h1>

<ul>
<li>Member pointers can be marked by one of the keywords <code>own</code> or <code>share</code> but are owned by default.</li>
<li>For parameters, both keywords can be used again. But they are shared by default.</li>
<li>For return types, both keywords can be used again. But they are shared by default.</li>
<li>Local variables take on the type given by the assignment.</li>
<li>Shared variables can NOT be assigned to owning types.</li>
<li>Shared variables can be assigned to sharing types. Assigning results in decrementing the reference count of the previously stored shared pointer and incrementing the reference count of the newly assigned pointer.</li>
<li>Owned variables can be assigned to owning types (or transferred via parameters or return values). Doing so revokes the ownership of the previous scope or object and the new object/scope becomes the owner.</li>
<li>Owned variables can be assigned to sharing types. Upon assignment, if the <code>share</code> keyword is used, the owned pointer revokes all ownership and the pointer becomes a purely shared pointer. Without using the <code>share</code> keyword, the pointer is assigned the same as a shared pointer.</li>
<li>After assigning a previously-owned pointer, the pointer becomes NULL.</li>
<li>If the compiler detects the necessity, pointers are always stored with a reference count and a flag, whether they are owned or not.</li>
<li>When a pointer is owned, the reference count counts how many shared references there exist.</li>
<li>When an owned pointer gets deleted and there still are shared references, the runtime system executes an exception.</li>
<li>When an shared pointer gets deleted, its reference count gets decremented until the counter reaches zero. Then, if it is not owned by anyone, it gets deleted automatically.</li>
<li>Shared pointers can never become owned pointers again.</li>
<li>A type with <code>own</code> always is implicitely <code>mutable</code>.</li>
<li>The keyword <b><code>own</code></b> as a type means: This variable owns the pointer.</li>
<li>The keyword <b><code>share</code></b> as a type means: This variable stores a shared pointer.</li>
<li>The keyword <b><code>own</code></b> as an operator means: The ownership of the pointer is transferred to the receyving scope.</li>
<li>The keyword <b><code>share</code></b> as an operator means: The ownership of the pointer is revoked and shall never again be owned by anyone.</li>
<li>Not using any of the two keywords at all means: The ownership stays as it was before. The reference count though is handeled just the same as always.</li>
<li>Both keyword <b><code>own</code></b> and <b><code>share</code></b> can only be used as an operator acting upon an owned variable.</li>
