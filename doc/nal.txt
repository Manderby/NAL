
Target groups:
--------------
- Target groups: Application programmers, Embedded programmers.
- Not a target group: System programming. Too complicated. No chance this will ever work completely safe.



Iron rules
----------
- keywords do never contain underscores.
- keywords are always lowercase only and decimal digits.



Quality goals:
--------------
- Compiler error messages must be easy to read.
- Forward declarations not necessary. C-Header files including comments which are right before defined symbols will be automatically generated upon compilation. Needs proper definition of what is a "header" comment.
- includes. Shall be detected or found by the compiler automatically. Requires common rules on how to find implementation/header files. Maybe belongs to the build system. Needs further thinking.



Things to throw away
--------------------
- Ditch -> in favor of .
- No more short, long, int.
- No more char, use new keyword "letter" instead.
- Ditch "float" for "f32" and "double" for "f64" and "long double" for f128.
- No more postfix operators ++ --
- Underscore _ is no character. Debatable, probably not. People get angry. m_member is no longer possible. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE no longer possible.
- Replace do-while with a new keyword "dowhile". Put condition before {} Block.
- No more comma operator.
- Ditch unions.
- Ditch Bitfields.
- Disallow [] as type. Use new "array" type instead.



Needs more brain thinking things.
---------------------------------
- Ditch Dereference operator. Do it implicitely.
- no namespaces. Must be discussed further. Helps to find the proper space to look for errors. Needs to be looked at on how to include files. Maybe just one level, not multiple ones.
- Type and variabel declaration/definition: Proposed is to put the variable first, then the type.



Types:
------
- New type: "Byte"
- New integer types: i8, i16, i32, i64, ... u8, u16, u32, u64, ...
- New keyword "letter" for characters. Preferably UTF8
- New types "f32" and "f64" which repalce float and double.
- New type "bool", new keywords "true" and "false"
- Make array a native type (name under discussion. Some like vec but opposition is dwindling. Namespaces are problematic here as well). Proposition for syntax: array[i32, 6] whereas i32 is a type and 6 is the number of elements in the array. An array is fixed size.



Yet Uncategorized ideas:
------------------------
- string must be a language type.
- Replace struct with class keyword.
- Classes are automatically typedefd.
- Classes store a type id given at runtime.
- Classes declare public and protected methods, never privates.
- Classes have no implicit constructors or desctructors.
- Allow method to be pure. Need overwrite.
- this must be declared explicitely as a parameter.
- PIMPL must be prevented.
- Private methods must be present in the implementation file.
- Allow single inheritance
- Interfaces are extensions, not inheritance.
- Interfaces can be implemented outside of class to enhance classes.
- Disallow casts except base types and inherited pointer types.
- Error all implicit casts.
- Allocation can be with or without reference counted.
- Initialization should look like myVariable = MyType(params);
- Initialization from Allocation can be like ... = new MyType(...).
- Initialization from a function result does not need a type.
- Pointers are only created with new keyword.
- Replace Pointer arithmetics with iterators.
- Add yield and coroutine functionality.
- nullptr is an object which can be cast to but never from.
- Disallow void*. Add customType with runtime code generation with declareWithType. 
- No templates otherwise.
- Replace const optional with mutable explicit.
- Make inlines inline always.
- size_t becomes index.
- bleed keyword makes variables available outside of current scope.
- Do not allow reading from console. No scanf.
- No ascii mode for file input or output.
- Disallow tab character.
- Promote using less {}. Probably not a totally good idea. Keep them but make them optional.
- Variables are NOT initialized automatically.
- Do not define multiple variables with ,
- Add named parameters. Make them optional.
- arguments and parameter names must be equal.
- no asm



Some discussion points from the stream:
---------------------------------------
- Function overloading could be cool.
- bleed bleed bleed is bad.
- lifetime of bleed. See as an example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html
- Variadic initialization. Needs discussion.
- Adding a list implementation.
